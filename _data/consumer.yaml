  title: Consuming APIs 101
  description: >-
    APIs came in to existence to satisfy a demand for access to valuable
    content, data and resources, and the more APis that are developed, the more
    the appetite for API consumption has grown. APIs enable website, web and
    mobile applications to build applications, using resources that were
    completely out of reach in even the recent past. Some API resources, like a
    simple city look-up by postal code, might be simple enough that a developer
    could recreate, but other resources such as global satellite imagery is
    something the average developer does not have the resources, or the time to
    createâ€”the more API resources available, the cooler the apps we build, and
    the more we hunger for valuable API resources grows.

  title: Starts with a Need
  description: >-
    <p>API consumers rarely want to use an API, just to learn about APIs, they
    have a need, a problem they need to solve. They want to provide a feature in
    their website, or mobile application. Often times people just want two
    systems to talk to each other, or be able to analyze and visualize
    information in a particular way, to accomplish a business or personal
    objective.</p><p>When helping folks understand what is possible with APIs, I
    always ask about their motivations for doing APIs. APIs can be a lot of
    different things to a lot of different people, and helping make sure API
    conversations are relevant to your business, career, and personal interests
    helps make it something you'll keep coming back to learn more about.</p>

  title: Discovering The APIs You Need
  description: >-
    The API savvy technologists are aware of the vast wealth of APis available
    today, and know to Google for the API they need, visit API directories like
    ProgrammableWeb or Mashape, and emerging API search engines like APIs.io.
    Even with the handful of API discovery solutions out there, sometimes the
    best way to find an API is by using a search engine, and just relying on the
    web to find machine readable versions of the data and content you are
    needing.

  title: Authentication
  description: >-
    Before you can unlock the value of an API, you need to understand how common
    authentication patterns work for any API. Some API providers use basic
    authentication, which is baked into HTTP, while others use application or
    developer keys to be able to talk with APIs. oAuth is fast becoming default
    for API providers who serve up private users information, allowing platforms
    to manage identity and access in a way that gives control over to end-users
    of applications built on top of APIs. Many providers are also using SSL as
    default for all API communication, protecting API consumption.

  title: Integration
  description: >-
    Actual integration between applications and APIs, is ultimately up to API
    consumers, but API providers and a growing number of API tools and services,
    are making API integrations easier, and often automated. Most web API
    resources can be accessed via a simple URL, something anyone, with a basic
    amount of web knowledge, can integrate API resources into their world.

  title: Software as a Service (SaaS)
  description: >-
    <p>The primary motivation for API integration is to provide access to data,
    content, and other resources available in online Software as a Service
    (SaaS) platforms. Services like Evernote for notes, Pinboard for links,
    Flickr for photos, and Youtube for videos, all use APIs to enable
    integration with other applications, as well as basic data portability for
    software users.</p><p>Learning about the APIs that exist for the services
    you already depend on is a great way to apply APIs in a meaningful way, that
    can make an impact on how you work and do business. If you are using the
    mobile app of any online platform, there is a good chance they have an API
    that you can also put to use to better make sense of the data, content,
    images, video, and other information you depend on online.

  title: Embeddable Tools
  description: >-
    The popularity of platforms like Twitter and Facebook owe a great deal of
    their buzz to the fact that there were embeddable buttons, badges, and
    widgets, allowing for the sharing, syndication, and engagement with their
    platform using API driven, embeddable tools. The ability to copy and paste a
    little bit of code, maybe configure a few settings, and be able to publish
    data, content, media, and other digital resources is the cornerstone of any
    API integration.

  title: Web Hooks
  description: >-
    Webhooks enable API platforms to push data, and notify any other URL of a
    change or event that has occurred via the platform. Webhooks are how API
    platforms become a two way street, allowing API consumers to make APIs work
    for them, and reduce the overhead of application usage when it comes to
    polling API resources. Webhooks are an API integrators best friend, and
    always look for them on platforms before considering which resource is best
    for your application or use case.

  title: Terms of Service
  description: >-
    Everything on the Internet today is guided buy the terms of service of web
    and mobile applications, and their underlying API platforms. TOS dictate how
    developers can use APIs, and the end-users can take advantage of services on
    the platform. Nobody reads TOS before they sign up for online services, but
    if you are looking to build a business on top of any API, you should read
    the TOS to see if it is something that will support what you are looking to
    do.

  title: In Perfect World Everyone Provides and Consumes API
  description: >-
    There are over thousands of public APIs available on the open Internet, and
    if you are building applications, you are most likely consuming APIs, as
    well as designing, deploying, and managing your own APIs. The best API
    providers, consume their own APIs, as well as the APIs of other providers.
    To truly understand what makes a good API, you should be consuming, as well
    as providing APIs.

  title: APIs Today
  description: >-
    We are moving well beyond the old days of API mashups, or even applications
    using just a handful of APis. Applications are depending on entire stack of
    APIs, employing 10s or 100s of API resources to deliver applications across
    multiple web and mobile channels. Consuming APIs aren't just for developers,
    and about building applications, APIs are fueling many new trends that allow
    even non-developers to consume APIs and put them to use in documents,
    spreadsheets, and other common tools we depend on everyday for our personal
    and professional lives.
